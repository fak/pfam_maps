        <p class="lead">Privileged Pfam-A domains mediate small molecule binding</p> 
        <div class="well">
            <p>Welcome to ppdms - a platform that facilitates manual refinements of a mapping of small molecule binding to Pfam-A domains. The mapping aims to link measurements of small molecule bioactivity stored in the <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb/"> ChEMBL</a> database to regions within a given protein that are described by <a target="_blank" href="http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/help#tabview=tab3"> Pfam-A </a> domains. By associating bioactivity with a protein domain, rather than the whole length protein, the mapping enables meaningful alignments of drug targets and ligand-fishing approaches. </p>
        </div>
        <h4>How the mapping works</h4>
        <p> 
            The mapping relies on a catalogue of Pfam-A domains that are known to mediate  
            small molecule binding.
            This catalogue was established in a <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/S17/S11">study </a> presented at InCoB2012 and later refined as described in my PhD thesis. 
            This catalogue is the projected onto all protein targets in the ChEMBL database.
            As illustrated below, the projection can result in three different outcomes:
            <ul>
                <li> successful map to a single domain    </li>
                <li> no map to any domain                 </li>
                <li> conflicting maps to multiple domains </li>
            </ul>

        </p>
        <p> The table below summarises how activities in the current release distribute over the three possible outcomes. Note that this summary is for activities from both functional and binding assays with an assigned pChEMBL value. PPDMs currently runs with version {{ chembl_version }} </p>
        <table class="table table-striped" style=width:300px>

             <td> {{ n_straight.0}} </td>
             <td>{{ n_straight.1  }}</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>

             <td> 100 </td>
         </tr>
     </table>
     <p> The table below presents a breakdown of activities that have been assigned to more than one domain. 'Ambiguous' means that the activity was mapped to more than one domain of the same type. At the momemt, ppdms does not offer a method to resolve such mappings.</p>

        <h4>How ppdms mappings work</h4>
        <p>
        Very simple... well, almost very simple.
        Initially, the mappings are assigned using the catalogue of privileged Pfam-A domains, as outlined in the figure above.
        The mapping is applied to all activities that derive from binding or functional assays and have a pChEMBL value assigned to them.
        The process assigns three flags to each activity, the <strong>status_flag</strong>, the <strong>manual_flag</strong>, and the <strong>category_flag</strong>.
        The status_flag defines whether a given mapping is valid or not.
        The manual flag defines whether a mapping has been curated manually or not.
        The category flag defines the nature of the mapping, whether it was assigned successfully, or with conflict, or whether no mapping could be assigned to a given activity.
        The manual_flag is on 0 by default and set to 1, when a manual assignment hass been made in the Conflicts section of ppdms, and back to 0 if the assignment has been revoked in the Resolved section.
        In an independent release cycle, all mappings with a manual flag are exported and used to override the automatic mapping procedure. Thus they are perpetuated in subsequent releases of ppdms and ChEMBL.
        </p>
        <h4>How can I access ppdms mappings from the main schema?</h4>
        <p>Mappings that have already been processed as described above can be accessed directly through the main schema of the ChEMBL database. A few examples are provided below. </p>
        <p>Below an exemplary query to pull back all mappings for the Bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase of Toxoplasma Gondii. </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-sql">
        SELECT pdb.predbind_id, a.assay_id, dom.domain_name, cs.description, a.description
        FROM component_sequences cs -- obtaining target sequences from component_sequences.
        JOIN target_components tc -- linking through to activities table via target_components and assays.
          ON cs.component_id = tc.component_id
        JOIN assays a
          ON tc.tid = a.tid
        JOIN activities act -- activities table is the connecting element in this query.
          ON a.assay_id = act.assay_id
        JOIN predicted_binding_domains pdb -- linking to domains table through predicted_binding_domains and site_components.
          ON pdb.activity_id = act.activity_id
        JOIN site_components sc
          ON pdb.site_id = sc.site_id
        JOIN domains dom -- obtaining domain names from domains. 
          ON dom.domain_id = sc.domain_id
        WHERE cs.accession = 'Q07422';
        </pre>

        A query to obtain all mappings for approved drugs to protein domains could look like this. Note that this query does not contain any potency threshold. This means some of the associations may have been tested but no evidence of interaction was found. 

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-sql">
        SELECT DISTINCT md.pref_name,  dom.domain_name, indication_class
        FROM activities act -- activities table is the connecting element in this query.
        JOIN predicted_binding_domains pdb -- linking to domains table through predicted_binding_domains and site_components.
          ON pdb.activity_id = act.activity_id
        JOIN site_components sc
          ON pdb.site_id = sc.site_id
        JOIN domains dom -- obtaining domain names from domains. 
          ON dom.domain_id = sc.domain_id
        JOIN molecule_dictionary md
          ON md.molregno = act.molregno
        WHERE md.max_phase >= 4 AND dosed_ingredient=1 AND therapeutic_flag=1
        ORDER BY md.pref_name;
        </pre>
